# Word Search:

A winform program to either:
 1. extract all the possible words from a word search box or
 2. find a list of expected words in a word search box

Initially thought of as an experiment into how best to apply this via a web application while the logic was server side but the visualisation was client side. (Just to have a play with websockets or something.)

However I ended up doing the first iteration in WinForms just to get a UI up and running simply. I may get around to the web UI one day!
